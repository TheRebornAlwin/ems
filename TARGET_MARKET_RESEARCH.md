## TARGET MARKET SOPHISTICATION LEVEL

### Stage 3 Sophistication

**The market has seen many claims. They're skeptical. They want proof of mechanism.**

#### Strategic Moves for Stage 3 Market:

### 1. Lead With a Clear, Unique Mechanism

Not claims. Not hype. A simple explanation of how Electromain rewires homes differently.

**Example:**
> "Our Clean Rewire Method keeps your home protected, tidy, and powered at the end of every day."

(This becomes your "unique mechanism.")

### 2. Show the Process Visually

Stage 3 buyers want certainty. Use a simple, visual 4-step system:

1. **Survey**
2. **Plan**
3. **Rewire**
4. **Test & certify**

This builds trust instantly.

### 3. Lean Hard Into Proof

People don't believe "experienced electrician." They believe:

- **Before/after photos**
- **Case studies**
- **Stories of real jobs**
- **Certificates issued**
- **5-star reviews from rewire clients only**

Put these high on the page.

### 4. Use Transparency as the Differentiator

Most electricians hide everything. We flip it. Show:

- **Realistic cost ranges**
- **Exact timelines**
- **What disruption to expect**
- **How you protect the home**
- **What the client gets at the end** (certificates, testing, sign-off)

This immediately sets Electromain apart.

### 5. Position Electromain as "The Rewire Specialists"

- Not a handyman
- Not "general electrical services"
- **Rewires only**
- **Medium → big jobs only**

Specialisation slices straight through the noise.

## TARGET MARKET VERBATIM LANGUAGE

**Use these EXACT phrases and sentiments from real customers in copy:**

> "They went above and beyond at short notice and turned around a full rewire in 3 days without compromising on the quality."

> "My husband and myself bought a property that required a full rewire, this wasn't something we budgeted for so we shopped around for someone offering finance, we choose home rewires because of the reviews and the payment options. The team was so accommodating, reassuring and honestly was extremely helpful with the initial visit."

> "I was expecting an extremely stressful process but I was so wrong! It was stress free, they kept us updated throughout the whole process and it only took a few days, they even organised the plasterer to come out after the work had been complete as well, which was extremely helpful and also added to the stress free process."

> "Their advice helped us have a better set up and save money. The group grafted for 4 days straight and even stayed until 11pm on the last day so we could be back in our house sooner."

> "From start to finish the work has been smooth, I needed a full rewire as part of a project and had lots of other work booked in."

> "Corey and the team were great from start to finish, very clean and efficient. The communication from the office prior to starting work was also efficient."

> "I highly recommend Cheshire rewire. Their professionalism shone through from quote to completion. Great communication and the guys who did the work were polite, friendly, efficient and very clean."

> "The job was done quickly and to a high standard. They communicated really well throughout and made sure I was totally satisfied before they signed it off."

> "Couldn't recommend this company any higher gave us a start and finish date and bang on time would definitely recommend Home rewire to anyone kept in touch with us all the way through the job thank you very much"

## TOP PLAYER ANALYSIS - KEY TAKEAWAYS

### What Top Players Do Well:
- Specialise in rewires (not random small jobs)
- Show clear process (survey → quote → installation → testing → certification)
- Push safety & compliance hard (NICEIC, NAPIT, TrustMark, BS7671)
- Highlight minimal disruption (dust sheets, tidiness, respectful workers)
- Emphasise certification and digital paperwork
- Show areas served clearly
- Offer free quotes and fast response

### What They're NOT Doing (ElectroMain Opportunities):
- ❌ Very few show strong before/after visuals
- ❌ Almost none show real case studies of full rewires
- ❌ They don't show cost guides or ballpark ranges
- ❌ Websites feel generic and template-like — no emotional pull
- ❌ Don't use customer stories, only basic reviews
- ❌ Don't show fast turnaround, real timelines, or project examples
- ❌ Almost none show human connection (faces, team photos, vans, personality)
- ❌ Don't speak to the renovation mindset
- ❌ Rarely address the fear: "I don't want my home torn apart by cowboys"

### How ElectroMain Can Beat Them:
1. ✅ Lead with rewires only (medium to large jobs only)
2. ✅ Hammer the process visuals (simple 4-step graphic)
3. ✅ Show before/after rewires with real images
4. ✅ Add a "Do I need a rewire?" diagnostic section
5. ✅ Use local trust anchors (South Wales, Swansea, Cardiff)
6. ✅ Add a price guide (even a range builds trust)
7. ✅ Make the site feel human — real team photos, vans, clients, homes
8. ✅ Add strong proof: testimonials from rewire clients only
9. ✅ Use speed & response time as a selling point
10. ✅ Add a cleanliness promise (dust sheets, protect furniture, vacuum)
11. ✅ Make the homepage feel safe, simple, and modern, not corporate
